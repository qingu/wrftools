## Dependencies

### External tools

The following external tools are required. All are findable via your favourite search engine.

* WRF        - obviously
* WPS        - ditto
* gribmaster - fetches external boundary conditions 
* NCL        - for visualisation and time-series extraction
* NCO        - needed for adding metadata and compression (compiled with netCDF4 support)

### Python dependecies

Despite trying to reduce the python dependencies to a bare minimimum, 
there are still some modules which are not included with a standard
python installation. These are:

* pyyaml - needed if yaml is used for config files (recommended)
* docopt - intelligent parsing of command-line arguments
* numpy

## Quick start

 1. Clone wrftools repository `git clone https://github.com/samwisehawkins/wrftools.git`
 2. Create a local working directory
 3. Link `run_forecast.py` into working directory 
 4. Copy `examples/forecast.yaml` into working directory 
 5. Edit the new `forecast.yaml` file
 6. `$> python run_forecast.py --config=forecast.yaml`
